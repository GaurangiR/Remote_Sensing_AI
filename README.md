Remote Sensing AI Using Minimal Input
Reconstructing satellite images from abstract or degraded inputs using deep learning (Autoencoders, SSIM, VGG Loss)

🚀 Project Overview
This project explores the ability of deep learning models to reconstruct high-fidelity satellite imagery from minimally informative inputs such as blurred, masked, or noisy images. Inspired by DARPA's Project Stargate, this AI system aims to aid in scenarios where only partial, abstract, or corrupted data is available for geospatial analysis—e.g., during disasters, occlusions, or low-bandwidth transmissions.

🎯 Objectives
📉 Restore degraded satellite images using deep learning.

🧠 Leverage Autoencoders with perceptual and structural loss functions.

📊 Evaluate reconstruction using SSIM, PSNR, and MSE.

🌐 Apply the model on the UCMerced LandUse dataset.
